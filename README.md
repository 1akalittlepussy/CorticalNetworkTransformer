# Cortical Classification with Transformer Models

This project implements a Transformer-based model for classifying cortical data. It includes various modules for data loading, processing, and model definition.

## Project Structure

- `train.py`: The main file to run the training process.
- `load_data.py`: Module for loading and preprocessing the dataset.
- `code_utils.py`: Contains utility functions for calculating correlations and binarization.
- `Transformer/models.py`: Defines the `CorticalNetworkTransformer` model architecture.
- `Transformer/layers.py`: Implementation of the Transformer encoder layers.
- `Transformer/position_encoding.py`: Functions for position encoding used in the Transformer model.
